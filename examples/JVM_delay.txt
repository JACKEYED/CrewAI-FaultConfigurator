# Agent: Fault Requirement Analyst
## Task: 
        1. User failure use case requirements: Please help me inject a communication type fault to the order service.

        2. If necessary, you can call human_tool to let users enter missing information and ultimately get complete information.Calling the tool requires passing in the information you want the user to input.

        3. Extract key information such as target service of fault injection, injected fault type, injected fault mode, and necessary arguments information.
     
    
Please specify the type of communication fault you would like to inject (e.g., network delay, packet loss, service unavailability), the mode of fault injection (e.g., continuous, intermittent), and any additional parameters or conditions necessary for the fault scenario (e.g., duration of the fault, packet loss rate).

# Agent: Fault Requirement Analyst
## Thought: In order to generate a comprehensive preliminary requirements document for the fault injection use case, I need to gather more details about the specific communication fault you wish to inject into the order service. This includes understanding the type of communication fault, the mode in which you want the fault to be injected, and any specific parameters or conditions that need to be considered.
## Using tool: human_input
## Tool Input: 
"{\"information_needed\": \"Please specify the type of communication fault you would like to inject (e.g., network delay, packet loss, service unavailability), the mode of fault injection (e.g., continuous, intermittent), and any additional parameters or conditions necessary for the fault scenario (e.g., duration of the fault, packet loss rate).\"}"

   - Communication Fault

3. Fault Injection Mode:
   - Delay (specifically a 10-second delay)

4. Specific Details:
   - Target Component: Java Virtual Machine (JVM) associated with the Order Service
   - Duration of Fault: 10 seconds

5. Additional Parameters:
   - None specified

This preliminary document captures the essence of the required fault injection scenario where a 10-second communication delay is introduced within the JVM for the order service, as per the user's specifications.


# Agent: Prompt Generation Agent
## Task: 
        1. Select the most appropriate tool for the current injection based on your experience(you need to explain to the user why you chose it).

        3. To make the prompt more general, you do not need to generate a specific configuration file.

        4. Provide the execution methods for the corresponding tools and injection environments.

        2. Generate prompt words to give to the agent in the next stage base on above description.

    


# Agent: Prompt Generation Agent
## Final Answer: 
1. **Selected Tool**: ChaosBlade is chosen for this use case because it offers the capability to conduct chaos experiments directly on JVM environments, allowing precise control over Java application behaviors, including injecting communication delays.

2. **Execution Method**:
   - **CLI Command Mode**: Use this method to directly execute experiments targeting the JVM associated with the Order Service. The CLI will facilitate the delay injection seamlessly, aligning with the requirement of a 10-second delay in communication.

3. **Prompt Template for Next Stage Agent**:
   ```
   Use ChaosBlade to inject a communication delay within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) environment associated with the Order Service. Implement a 10-second delay to simulate the specified communication fault. Employ the CLI Command Mode for accurate and effective fault injection, ensuring that only the targeted Order Service component is affected. Monitor the outcomes to assess how the latency impacts the service performance and reliability.
   ```  

This prompt template is designed to guide the next stage agent in executing the fault injection experiment accurately, as per the preliminary requirements of creating a delay within a JVM.
